### Inspiration
Svelta was greatly inspired by ![Vuexy](https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-vuejs-admin-dashboard-template/landing/) 
I really love their design(esp. the colors used) and it a great recommendation for every. Seeing that they had support for Vue and React challenged me to make a Svelta. I wanted to try my hands on something real and professional with Svelte and Tailwind CSS hence Svelta was born. Svelta = Svelte + Tailwind 

### Reinventing the wheel?
Why make another UI component kit when we already got Smelte and SMUI? What's so special about Svelte?

I must say that I really love ![Smelte](https://smeltejs.com/) and ![Svelte Material UI](https://sveltematerialui.com) but I really want to take full control and have the ability to mess up the components my way to let it flow with my theme. Infact, Svelta was inspired by them.

### How to use it?
**Option 1: (Recommended)**
Star this repo(it really means a lot to me) and just dig into the component folder and copy paste the code in your project. This way you can temper with the components anyhow you want to and break things and if things get messy,  just copy paste again. Also, no additional files from npm

**Note**: Some components depend on others, so be sure to include them or write up yours. And don't forget to check the import paths.


**Option 2** Actually, there's no option 2. I don't plan to push this to npm, cause I'm in favour with Deno's approach. But if really want this on npm, let me know. 

### Maintainance
Worrying abot this repo bieng maintained regulary? Be rest assured. I use these components personally so am sure i will be updating them frequently. 

### Buy me a coffee?
Sorry, I don't do caffaine, neither does PayPal work in my country(Ghana) but if you really want to support me, a star on this repo is priceless to me.
