### Inspiration
Svelta was greatly inspired by [Vuexy](https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-vuejs-admin-dashboard-template/landing/).  I love their design(esp. the colours used) and it a great recommendation for everyone. Seeing that they had support for Vue and React challenged me to make Svelta. I wanted to try my hands on something real and professional with Svelte and Tailwind CSS hence Svelta was born. Svelta = Svelte + Tailwind

### Reinventing the wheel?
Why make another UI component kit when we already got [Smelte](https://smeltejs.com/) and [SMUI](https://sveltematerialui.com/)? What's so special about Svelta?
I must say that I really love them but I really want to take full control and have the ability to mess up the components my way to let it flow with my stlye. Svelta was inspired by them.

### How to use it?
**Option 1 (Recommended):** Star this repo(it means a lot to me) and fork this repo or just dig into the component folder and copy-paste the component you need into your project. This way you can temper with the components anyhow you want to and break things and if things get messy, just copy-paste again. Also, no additional files from npm
Note: Some components depend on others, so be sure to include them or write up yours. And don't forget to check the import paths.


**Option 2** Actually, there's no option 2. I don't plan to push this to npm, cause I'm in favour with [Deno's](https://deno.land/) approach. But if you want this on npm, let me know.

### Maintainance
Worrying about this repo being maintained regularly? Be rest assured. I use these components personally so am sure I will be updating them frequently.

### Buy me a cup of coffee?
Sorry, I don't like caffeine, neither does PayPal work in my country(Ghana) but if you want to support me, a star on this repo is priceless to me.

### Contribute?
PR's are welcomed.Feel free to add your components to this repo as long as they are flexible and customizable. I prefer you use Tailwind CSS to style up your components and pass a prop tp override rhe classes you've used.
